# practicealgorithms
This Repository consists of a list of algorithms written in Python designed to reflect on computational complexity. It will follow the structure of the MIT course 6.006 Introduction to Algorithms. Each subfolder is designed to reflect on a particular problem discussed further in this README. Complexity analysis of each of these problems can be found in the subfolders themselves.

## Peak Finder
The Peak Finder problem (in 1 dimension) has the following problem statement

> Given an n-dimensional array (which is unsorted) return True if the array has a peak (if there is a peak) or False if there is no peak. Here a peak is defined as an element which is larger than or equal to its adjacent elements. **Note**: Edges have only one adjacente element used for comparison.
